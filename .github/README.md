# My NixOS Configuration

I'm trying to make this as modular as possible, list of available options are in the default.nix files. They are supposed to be configured in the hosts dir, my configuration is desktop.nix (I'll add a laptop.nix later), one can reference that as an example.

I will work on this over the coming months and it may not be stable, although I strive to make it that way - I seriously won't add any debt for now, meaning no backwards compatibility for now (if ever).

As I learn more about Nix I will try to match and improve the structure of this project, the further I go the more I notice how deep this particular rabbit hole called 'Nix' really is... Well, anyways. Thanks for reading and peace out. *awkwardly shows a peace sign and dissipates into the air*
